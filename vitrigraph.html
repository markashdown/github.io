<h1>Research: Vitrigraph</h1>

<p>
<b>Please note:</b>
The Vitrigraph program is not available to download because
it is not in a state suitable for release to the public. If you
would like to take the Java source code and improve the program
then email me.
</p>

<p>
Vitrigraph was created as the third-year project for the B.A. Hons Computer
Science from the University of Cambridge.  The aim of the project was to create
an application program that can be used to design stained glass windows.  The
emphasis was on features that assist the physical realisation and financial
evaluation of the designs. An extension was implemented to create ray-traced
pictures. These allow a design to be evaluated aesthetically, prior to
construction. The program has achieved the aims of the project. It provides a
simple interface for the non-technical user, to design a detailed window with
intuitive manipulation of graphical objects. The novel underlying data
structure provides support for algorithms that detect design faults, calculate
the production cost based on raw materials and complexity, and produce pleasing
and realistic ray-traced images.  
</p>

<p class="whitebox">
A design for a stained glass window is stored with a modified version of
the winged-edge data structure, that has not only straight edges but three
other types: quadratic and cubic Beziers, and arcs.

Edges are created, vertices are dragged around, and
the facets are filled with various types of glass.

The ray-tracer output for a complex design. This style of output, 
called 'sunbeam', provides
a compelling depiction of the design to present to a customer.

Listed below are the achievement criteria for the Vitrigraph
application, with explanations of how they were met
</p>

<table class="whitetable" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
  <th>The user must be able to create a stained glass pattern using 
  simple constructs that are combined graphically.</th>
  <td>Manipulation of patterns is simple and straightforward. 
  Optimisations have ensured the interactive user interface remains 
  responsive even for large, complex patterns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>The graphical representation of the pattern should relate 
  directly to the intended physical design, and incorporate 
  information such as the type of each piece of lead and glass.</th>
  <td>This is the case. The Java routines used to create the 
  printouts are also used to draw the pattern on the screen, 
  so what you see is what you get.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>It must be possible to load and save designs from and to files.</th>
  <td>This facility has been included and tested.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>It must be possible to produce printouts of the whole pattern 
  or parts of it, from which the stained glass window can be 
  constructed.</th>
  <td>This facility has been included and tested. It provides an 
  accurate method for cutting the glass facets.
  Individual facets can be printed on a small-format printer, or 
  the whole life-sized pattern can be printed on a large-format 
  printer and used as a template for assembly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Financial evaluation routines should compute the cost of 
  producing the window. The routines should give an accurate costing 
  for patterns of varying size and complexity.</th>
  <td>The evaluation routines give quite accurate cost analyses for 
  the test patterns. 
  These can be used as a guide to pricing, but the price of a 
  stained glass window should ultimately be set by an expert:
  there are many factors that affect the difficulty of constructing 
  a particular pattern: some types of glass may be harder 
  to cut than others, certain window shapes will be more difficult 
  to achieve, and the craftsman will be more efficient at constructing 
  a pattern in a style with which he is familiar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>The program must be able to present the pattern in a form 
  that makes it easy to visualise the finished product. Aesthetic 
  evaluation must be possible.</th>
  <td>The ray-tracer translation system allows patterns to be 
  assessed aesthetically by people with no experience in stained 
  glass or computing.</td>
</tr>
